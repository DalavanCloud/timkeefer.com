Javascript:
- jsc cli tool
- node.js for json webservices
- bookmarklets (could be used for handpicking green items)

Perl:
- use 5.14.1 (Perlbrew could help with this)
  name function args func myfunc($var1, $var2)
  //= is the same as if defined
  state variable
  given-when
  for line-start/line-end use \A \Z instead of ^ and $  
  ~~ smart match
  IPC::Sytem:::Simple qw(system capture)
    capture() is ``
  regular expression named captures 

- Try::Tiny - try catch
- use Carp; croak instead of die
- App::perlbrew
- module-starter

Perl Plack (Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)

- Starman - webserver ***
- Dancer - simple framework that can leverage Starman & Plack
- Carton - versioned perl lib installs (grab from github)

  Twiggy - async webserver
  Feersum - super fast async
  fastpass

  - cpamn --installdeps .
  DPAN, Shipwright

- Plack::Builder
  ServerStatus::Lite
  Runtime
  ErrorDocument

Python:
- python3 is here and several python flags (python -3) will
  help migrate py2 code to py3
- as soon as django has a py3 port we can switch

- Unicode is a table - a number to a string
- encoding is taking the unicode value and putting it into bytes
- decoding is going from a string of bytes to a unicode value


Django Worst and Best (Jacob Kaplan-Moss):

Presentation Akido - Damian Conway

* you're here for the audience

7 simple rules

Be...

1. competent
- talk about actual experiences
- if you don't know about it, don't talk about it
2. passionate
- talk about what you care about it
- be excited - Tim Bunce, quiet yet passionate
- tip - be upfront about how dull something may be
3. entertaining
- entertaining trumps information
- in 30 minutes all you can do is give an "overview"
- give the audience a simple structure that they can
  walk away with
- present in a way that it comes across as this is "simple"
  "easy to understand", attainable to the audience
- build the basic ideas, analogies to the audience - "scaffolding"
- comprehensible, resonant, memorable = entertaining
- tell a story
4. prepared
- 20 hours of work per 1 hour of delivery
- ask yourself "what could I say?" instead of "what should I say?"
- then prune all but 5 points, these become the chapters
- bucket the rest of the items into the 5 points
- find a narrative that connects the 5 points
5. stylish
- style is the delivery method for the content, so, style
  must be greater than content
- no more than 5 bullets, 5 words
6. engaging
7. yourself


Sessions Day 1

Javascript is Everywhere - Stoyan Stefanov

cli - jsc, rhino, node.js

sudo ln /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/Versions/A/Resources/jsc /bin/jsc

bookmarklets -
browser extensions - cfx tool

Perl 5.14 - Richardo Signes

each now takes references

Python 3, The Next Generation - 

"print" is becoming a function i.e. print( 'me!' )
all strings are unicode by default
new mutable bytesarray

* class MyClass(object):
except ValueError as e:
raise ValueError(e)
single int type

Perl Best Practices - Jacinta

use 5.14.1
//= is the same as if defined
state variable
given-when
~~ smart match
IPC::Sytem:::Simple qw(system capture) 
  - capture() is ``

Try::Tiny - try catch
use Carp; croak instead of die
App::perlbrew
module-starter
func nom($var1, $var2)
method get()

\A start of line 
\Z end of line
named captures - just like pyton
